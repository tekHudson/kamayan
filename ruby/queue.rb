      # need to implement `each` for that collection if you use something other
      # than DoublyLinkedList.

    # Define a method "enqueue" which takes a single argument. This method should
    # add the argument to the end of the queue, which should increase the size by
    # 1. The return value must be self.

    # Define a method "dequeue" which takes no arguments. This method should
    # remove and return the first value in the queue. An IndexError should be
    # raised if the Queue is empty.

    # Define a method "empty?" which takes no arguments. This method should return
    # whether or not the size is 0.

    # Define a method "peek" which takes no arguments. This method should return
    # the first value in the queue, without removing any elements in the queue.
