  # Define a method "[]=" which takes 2 arguments. This method should set the
  # value at the index defined in the first argument such that array_list[index]

  #
  # If the index is negative, an IndexError should be raised.

  # If the index is bigger than the current size of the @array, the @array
  # should be replaced with a bigger FixedArray to fit the new index. All
  # indexes between the former last element and the new index should be
  # initialized with nil. An additional buffer should be included in the new
  # FixedArray (in case the array is grown more), though this is not required.
  #
  # The size after this method is called depends on the index provided. An
  # existing index would not affect the size, but an index greater than the last
  # index will add the difference to the size.
