# In Ruby, the Array class represents a collection of items. However, an Array
# in Ruby is not like the arrays in other languages. Typically, an array in
# another language represents a fixed block of memory for storing multiple
# copies of a certain type of object. The size of the array cannot change once
# it has been created.
#
# The Ruby Array is much more like the Java ArrayList. The size of an ArrayList
# is malleable just like a Ruby Array; items can be added and removed at any
# time.
#
# The FixedArray class represents the raw array you would find in languages like
# Java. It is implemented in fixed_array.rb. These tests are to help familiarize
# you with the concept. Take a look at how it is implemented once you have
# finished this serving of the Kamayan. You will be using it in further servings
# to implement other familiar data sets.
